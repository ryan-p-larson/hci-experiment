# Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction Experiment
This repo contains all of the technical work of a HCI experiment Ben Schroder and I are conducting for class. We are investigating the effect of the [data-ink ratio] on people's chart comprehension and recall. We are conducting the experiment via online, and then saving the data and analyzing it.

### Chart Types
  - Scatter plot
  - Box & Whisker plot
  - Bar charts

### Technicals
Libraries used: R Stats, Python, HTML & CSS, and jQuery. Initially I used D3, but it was too tedious to do 14 charts exclusively in D3. 

### Included
 * Datasets (9 for the experimental charts, 1 for the results)
 * Data formatting scripts (Python)
 * R Stats code for the plot creation (Includes GGPlot2, shapr, and other 3rd party libs)
 * HTML, CSS, & JS for the website used to run the experiment
 * Demographic survey, script, satisfaction survey
 * List of references, links to dataset
 
### Todos

 - Compile links and dataset descriptions
 - Edit code, comment it out
